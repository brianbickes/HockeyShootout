Project 1: Hockey Shootout

This is an interactive click based game where the player goes against a range of computer goalies in an effort to get the puck past them. Each goalie's skills get better with each round. there are a total of 4 rounds with the last round being the most difficult to win. The layout of this game is simple and easy to play and relies on matching your shot against the goalie's ability to save the puck.
In this game, a series of functions are used to create the core mechanics of the game including the main function that dictates randomly on whether the user's shot is greater than the goalie's ability to save the puck. Stats can be easily manipulated in the code to make the goalies easier or more difficult to go up against and in turn the player's core stats can be easily manipulated to change the game on the fly. Jquery is used to insert the prompts and activity into the DOM and displayed for the user to see.
